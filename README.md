# TicTacToe
This TicTacToe exercise by TOP is trying to teach me a couple of things.
The most obvious is how to use the factory functions and IIFEs
But there are also some underlying things this exercise is trying to teach me and one of those is how to decouple my code.
How I can make sure that the logic of the game and the UI are kept separate and that the DOM only has access to those parts 
which are essential to displaying the game on screen and not to the logic.
So I'll try to use the "Building the HOuse" analogy by Alex Younger where I'll first write the logic and try to play the game, in it's entirety, in the console. Once I'm able to do that, I'll then move on to the UI.
