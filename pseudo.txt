the most important thing well need is the actual gameboard.
now we can create the gameboard using a 3x3 matrix and since we wont need it elsewhere we can probably 
place it in an IIFE.
there will be two players 
player1=X
player2=O
now for the logic of the actual game 
after every move we'll need to switch between the players and make sure
that the the users can't overwrite already made moves
since the only difference between the two players would be their markers so instead of creating 2 separate functions it would be better
if we created an active player and toggled between player1 and player2 using that variable
as for not being able to overwrite the input that has already been made can we initialize all the cells with a dummy value and 
a player can only place his move there if it contains that dummy element.
we can create factory function for the player objects.
as for the win condition the row and column win condition is pretty easy to implement if grid[a][1], grid[a][2], grid[a][3]=== X || O
one of the players won else if grid[1][a],grid[2][a], grid[3][a]===X || O then they win. 
as for the diagonal case we can explicitlly write the condition grid[a][a]==X || O where 0<=a<=2
